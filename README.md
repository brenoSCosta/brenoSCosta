ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a developer with two years of experience, focused on crafting modern and efficient solutions for web and mobile applications. My passion lies at the intersection of front-end and back-end, where I can build amazing user experiences and robust systems.

ðŸ’» On the front-end, I have solid experience with React, leveraging its power to create dynamic and responsive interfaces that captivate users from the first interaction.
