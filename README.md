ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a developer with two years of experience, focused on crafting modern and efficient solutions for web and mobile applications. My passion lies at the intersection of front-end and back-end, where I can build amazing user experiences and robust systems.

ðŸ’» On the front-end, I have solid experience with React, leveraging its power to create dynamic and responsive interfaces that captivate users from the first interaction.

ðŸ”§ On the back-end, I have primarily worked with Python, developing scalable and efficient services that drive the business logic behind applications.

ðŸ“± Additionally, I'm delving into the world of mobile development with Flutter, building elegant and functional interfaces that provide a consistent user experience across different platforms.
